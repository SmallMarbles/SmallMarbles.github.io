<h2>Ginger and Goldy, Inanimate Insanity ( Brian Koch, Fan )</h2>

<h3>the story;
goldy was a goldfish that I had for about<b> 8 </b> years.
When he died I felt like that he needed to be known. KNOWN BY EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD!
Ever since that he's been seen 3m+ times, So... I guess this exists now.</h3>
