  <h3>Here lays Krypton.</h3>
  <p id="demo">Most likely would be the best 2013 revival if not pussyness of Dev Team. The project is dead. Not because of the Roblox letter, rather because everyone was scared of it, being arrested and sued. Nobody would like to get sued by a big-ass company that will sue even a hobo if he's going to draw a Roblox character. Well, I guess that's been a good time with Dev Team, now, everything's ruined. But, well, what's good is that nobody can get sued anymore. <p id="yay">guys, we're doing another game, @swiftbed01</p>
